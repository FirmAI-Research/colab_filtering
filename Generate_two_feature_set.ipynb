    "I am not trying to solve particular problem. Theoretically the problem that everyone in finance is trying to solve is predict future returns, but there are too many inputs that you can look at, so it's better to find something that you can predict and then see if its useful. The reason I am looking at collaborative filtering and recommendation system is that when I try to describe how institutional stock ownership works in terms that are used in the recommendation systems framework, it does not sound ridiculous and also it might be possible to add pieces on top of it in a way that makes sense.\n",

    "$$r=p_i^T*q_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_i$ is the feature vector for the user and $q_j$ is the feature vector for the movie\n",
    "the netflix project winning paper also added a bias for each user and also a function of time as well as other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The straight forward translation of the model is there is a set of features that determine whether fund managers like the stock. example of features that i can think of are:\n",
    "1. The stock is in S&P500. some funds will buy it just so they can track S&P 500\n",
    "2. The stock is an energy stock and we are in a year like 2013 when the shale production oil production was growing but it was not that big, so there were a lot of stories about how the oil companies would make money and institutional ownership was high.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complicating features, which make me relatively sure the most simple model won't work are the following:\n",
    "1. Movie popularity might vary over time, and thats why the netflix paper has the time function built in, but its basically still the same movie, and the features that movies have and users value are also somewhat stationary over time.\n",
    "   With stocks its different, a stock that's cheap in 2012, might have gone up 100% and is expensive in 2014. so if cheapness was a feature of the stock and why people liked it at the time, it might the oppositve now.\n",
    "   On the demand side, when leading economic are about to trend down, funds might move from industrials and energy into utilities, or staples, so even if the stocks are the same the preference changes.\n",
    "2. The data is with delay, "
